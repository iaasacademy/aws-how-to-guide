This AWS how-to-guide will help you configure AWS Lambda and Amazon EventBridge to automatically start and stop EC2 Instances at designated times, Monday to Friday.
The use case for this is where you may wish to automate a typical operational task of starting and stopping EC2 instances when required by teams that need to perform tasks and run compute workloads.
The full use case along with architectural design pattern is provided in the associated PDF document. The following additional documents are provided: IAM Policy document and python code for AWS Lambda.
The AWS Lambda function uses the Default_Tags variable defined in the environmental variables to retrieve details of EC2 Instances that need to be automatically stopped and restarted. The Lambda function can perform both stop and start of your EC2 instance. You will need to confirm EventBridge to trigger the lambda function to both start and stop your EC2 instances at specified schedule. To get EventBridge to trigger either a stop or start event, you will need to pass a JSON constant to the lambda function. Full demonstration is provided in the how-to-guide video.
